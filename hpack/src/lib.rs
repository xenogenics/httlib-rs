//! This crate implements [HPACK], a compression format for efficiently
//! representing HTTP header fields in [HTTP/2]. It exposes a simple API for
//! performing the encoding and decoding of HTTP headers.

//!
//! ## About
//!
//! [HPACK] is a compression format that eliminates redundant header fields in
//! requests and responses. This is one of the features based on which the
//! [HTTP/2] protocol significantly reduces the amount of transferred data from
//! one entity to another.
//!
//! A significant shift in thinking is required from the implementer of the
//! [HTTP/2] protocol. A connection in [HTTP/2] does not represent a single
//! request/response session. We can start multiple simultaneous streams in one
//! connection, representing multiple request/response sessions, which was not
//! possible in the previous versions of the HTTP protocol. The [HPACK]
//! compressor uses this characteristic of [HTTP/2] by indexing headers
//! considering the whole connection and not per stream.
//!
//! The implementation of [HPACK] contains three main parts of the process:
//!
//! * `Indexing table` is a list, to which the HPACK saves the commonly used
//! headers. Each entity indexes headers per connection, separately for incoming
//! (decoding) and for outgoing (encoding) data.
//!
//! * `Encoder` performs the task of data compression. It converts the data from
//! its original readable form into an optimized byte sequence by applying the
//! rules defined in the HPACK specification.
//!
//! * `Decoder` takes over the task of the decompressor. It executes the
//! commands inversely to the encoder. It converts the data back into its
//! readable form.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! **Encoding example:**
//!
//! ```rust
//! use httlib_hpack::Encoder;
//!
//! let mut encoder = Encoder::default();
//!
//! let name = b":method".to_vec();
//! let value = b"PATCH".to_vec();
//! let flags = Encoder::HUFFMAN_VALUE | Encoder::WITH_INDEXING | Encoder::BEST_FORMAT;
//!
//! let mut dst = Vec::new();
//! encoder.encode((name, value, flags), &mut dst).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! **Decoding example:**
//!
//! ```rust
//! use httlib_hpack::Decoder;
//!
//! let mut decoder = Decoder::default();
//! let mut buf = vec![0x80 | 2];
//!
//! let mut dst = Vec::new();
//! decoder.decode(&mut buf, &mut dst).unwrap();
//!
//! for (name, value, flags) in dst {
//!     if flags & Decoder::NEVER_INDEXED == Decoder::NEVER_INDEXED {
//!         // sensitive header
//!     } else {
//!         // common header
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
