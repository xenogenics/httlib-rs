//! This crate implements [Protocol Buffers] binary protocol `v3` (`proto3`),
//! for encoding and decoding typed messages to and from the wire format. The
//! protocol deals in-depth with optimizing the representation of data types on
//! the wire so that as little data as possible is transmitted between the client
//! and server.

//!
//! ## About
//!
//! Protocol Buffers, also know as `protos` or `protobufs`, is an open-source
//! interface description language originally developed by Google and a library
//! that allows JSON-like data messages to be transmitted over the wire without
//! unnecessary ballast. Today, it is most relevant in the context of [gRPC],
//! where [RPC] server and client code for arbitrary programming languages is
//! generated based on Protocol Buffers descriptions.
//!  
//! Protocol Buffers were developed primarily with the goal of speeding up the
//! transmission of strongly typed key-value message objects over the network,
//! which in turn means reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted
//! over the wire from A to B.
//!
//! [REST] and [RPC] are two concepts that are now considered a kind of de facto
//! way of developing APIs in web development. Communication between the client
//! and the server is mostly about transferring data in [JSON] format. This is
//! user-friendly, but highly suboptimal at the network level.
//!
//! Protocol Buffers addresses this issue and is one of the most optimized
//! protocols which is also growing in popularity.
//!
//! This library is not meant for generating code for the client and the server.
//! The crate focuses on the low-level data compression and decompression for
//! transmitting typed objects over the wire. It offers the full implementation
//! of the Protocol Buffer's binary protocol.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! **Encoding example:**
//!
//! ```rust
//! use httlib_protos::{Encoder, EncoderLit};
//!
//! let encoder = Encoder::default();
//!
//! let mut dst = Vec::new();
//! encoder.encode((&1, &150i32), &mut dst).unwrap(); // common type
//! encoder.encode((&2, EncoderLit::SInt32(&-150i32)), &mut dst).unwrap(); // specific type
//! ```
//!
//! **Decoding example:**
//!
//! ```rust
//! use httlib_protos::{Decoder, DecoderLit};
//!
//! let mut decoder = Decoder::default();
//!
//! let mut buf = vec![0x85, 0x35, 0x85];
//!
//! let mut dst = vec![];
//! let size = decoder.decode(&mut buf, &mut dst).unwrap();
//!
//! for (tag, typ, byt) in dst.drain(..) {
//!     if tag == 1 {
//!         i32::from(DecoderLit::Int32(byt));
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
