//! Provides features for flattening Huffman tree and generating translation
//! matrix.
//!
//! [HPACK] documentation provides an already prepared and for the web optimized
//! Huffman code for all [ASCII] characters. To implement the Huffman algorithm
//! for [HPACK] we have to first flatten this table to a two-dimensional matrix.
//!
//! Let’s learn how to do this on a very simple example. Our algorithm will
//! enable the conversion of letters A, B, C, D, and E into a Huffman sequence.
//! The Huffman code for each letter is shown in the table below.
//!
//! | Character | Huffman code
//! |-|-
//! | A | 00
//! | B | 01
//! | C | 100
//! | D | 101
//! | E | 11
//!
//! We have decided to flatten the Huffman table into a matrix, enabling the
//! decoder to read Huffman bit-sequence 2-bits at a time. The illustration
//! below shows the table structure we need to fill in.
//!
//! | PATH | ID | SYM | LFT | 00 | 01 | 10 | 11
//! |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
//! | // | 0 | - | - | - | - | - | -
//!
//! The first column PATH will serve for our notes in which we’ll store read
//! bits so we will know what sequence refers to what table row. Reading of each
//! character’s code always starts in the root row marked with `//`. The column
//! `ID` will store the unique name of the row. The first row is marked with
//! `0`. The column `SYM` will store characters (e.g. A). Field `LFT` will store
//! the information about the leftover bits. A leftover bit is a number of bits,
//! missing to reach the full bit chunk (in our case 2 bits). For example,
//! letter C and D have a leftover of 1, because to reach a round number of
//! bits, which is in our case 2 bits * N, 1 bit remains. Letters A, B, and E
//! have no leftover. The remaining columns represent the read chunk of 2 bits
//! for all its possible values ranging from `00` (0) to `11` (3).
//!
//! The table above will now be filled with data of sample Huffman coding. As
//! mentioned previously, we are reading the Hoffman code 2-bits at a time.
//! Let’s see how to insert data to the table for the first letter A.  
//!
//! Letter A is represented with code `00`. Since there is no path `//00` for
//! this code in the first column, we create a new line with a new `ID`. There
//! is no leftover, and in the root line to column `00` we write the `ID` of the
//! newly established line. Since we read all the bits for the letter A, we also
//! write character A in the `SYM` column.
//!
//! | Path | ID | SYM | LFT | 00 | 01 | 10 | 11
//! |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
//! | // | 0 | - | - | 1 | - | - | -
//! | //00 | 1 | A | 0 | - | - | - | -
//!
//! We then repeat this process for the letter B. The letter B is represented
//! with code `01`. Since there is no path `//01` for this code, we create a
//! new line with a new `ID`. There is no leftover, and in the root line in
//! column `01` we write the `ID` of the newly established line. Since we read
//! all the bits for the letter B, we also write character B to the `SYM`
//! column.
//!
//! | Path | ID | SYM | LFT | 00 | 01 | 10 | 11
//! |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
//! | // | 0 | - | - | 1 | 2 | - | -
//! | //00 | 1 | A | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //01 | 2 | B | 0 | - | - | - | -
//!
//! The process for the letter C is somewhat different since its number of bits
//! doesn’t correspond to 2-bits * N. The final bit is therefore missing, so we
//! claim that it has a leftover of 1. First, we read the first 2 bits and
//! insert them in the table following the same process as before. After that,
//! we read the remaining bit, while assuming that all the possible variations
//! of the missing bit exist. This is marked with `X`. Since one bit is missing,
//! we note this in the column `LFT`.
//!
//! | Path | ID | SYM | LFT | 00 | 01 | 10 | 11
//! |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
//! | // | 0 | - | - | 1 | 2 | 3 | -
//! | //00 | 1 | A | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //01 | 2 | B | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //10 | 2 | B | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //10 | 3 | - | - | 4 | 4 | - | -
//! | //100X | 4 | C | 1 | - | - | - | -
//!
//! We repeat the process for letters D and E. The final table should look like
//! this:
//!
//! | Path | ID | SYM | LFT | 00 | 01 | 10 | 11
//! |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
//! | // | 0 | - | - | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6
//! | //00 | 1 | A | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //01 | 2 | B | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //10 | 2 | B | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //10 | 3 | - | - | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5
//! | //100X | 4 | C | 1 | - | - | - | -
//! | //101X | 5 | D | 1 | - | - | - | -
//! | //11 | 6 | E | 0 | - | - | - | -
//!
//! Note that it would be correct to replace the variants marked with X with
//! actual possible paths.
//!
//! | Path | ID | SYM | LFT | 00 | 01 | 10 | 11
//! |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
//! | // | 0 | - | - | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6
//! | //00 | 1 | A | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //01 | 2 | B | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //10 | 2 | B | 0 | - | - | - | -
//! | //10 | 3 | - | - | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5
//! | //1000 | 4 | C | 1 | - | - | - | -
//! | //1001 | 4 | C | 1 | - | - | - | -
//! | //1010 | 5 | D | 1 | - | - | - | -
//! | //1011 | 5 | D | 1 | - | - | - | -
//! | //11 | 6 | E | 0 | - | - | - | -
//!
//! The flattened form of the Huffman tree] in the form of a matrix plays a
//! crucial role in the process of decoding. We now have an idea of what the
//! process of decoding looks like, using this matrix. This module uses this
//! exact technic for creating N-bits translation matrix.
